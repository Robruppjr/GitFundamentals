# git clone

Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updted from the orignal repository.

It can be done with the `gt clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://gitub.com/elvenfiftyAcademy.TerminalDungeon.git
```
