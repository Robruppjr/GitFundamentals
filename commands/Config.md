# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commans in order to set up your identity.

for example, your identity can be set with the commans such as:

```
git config --global user.name "Arnold Shortman"
git config --global user.email aronoldshortman202@gmail.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
